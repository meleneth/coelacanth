1 CentralDispatch -> runs processes and notices when ports come back available because of clean vs not responding shutdown
1 GameBrowserServer -> Allows client connection to login, can transfer you to a WorldServer
5 WorldServer -> One Realm (spacestation)
many RoomServer -> dungeon etc

CentralDispatch should clean up child processes when it is killed
